Total Time Spent: 80 hours


11 Dec 2025 — 4 hours
Started thinking about the project idea and what I want to build.
Decided to make an alarm clock instead of a basic PCB project.
Looked into displays and input methods and felt rotary encoder would be better than buttons.
Did rough planning in my head and noted down component ideas.


12 Dec 2025 — 5 hours
Started working on the PCB schematic.
Added microcontroller and basic power connections.
Got confused with some pin connections and had to recheck datasheets.
Did not finish schematic fully today.


13 Dec 2025 — 6 hours
Continued PCB schematic work.
Connected OLED display and rotary encoder.
Made some mistakes with I2C pins and corrected them.
Learned more about pullups and power routing.


14 Dec 2025 — 7 hours
Started PCB layout.
Placed components multiple times to see what fits best.
First routing attempt was messy so I deleted it and restarted.
Understood how placement affects routing a lot.


15 Dec 2025 — 6 hours
Finished most of the PCB routing.
Ran DRC and fixed small errors.
Exported PCB files for checking.
Felt satisfied but noted things to improve later.


16 Dec 2025 — 7 hours
Started enclosure design in Fusion 360.
Imported PCB into CAD.
Tried placing all components inside enclosure.
Realized enclosure height was not enough.


17 Dec 2025 — 6 hours
Worked more on enclosure.
Faced issue where display was not reaching top of the box.
Tried adjusting connector height but it was not realistic.
Learned about real world mechanical constraints.


18 Dec 2025 — 8 hours
Explored different ways to mount the display.
Thought about spacers and enclosure cutout changes.
Made multiple small changes and tested fit.
This day took long because of trial and error.


19 Dec 2025 — 6 hours
Finalized enclosure shape.
Adjusted wall thickness and internal spacing.
Added mounting supports.
Exported full assembly STEP file.


20 Dec 2025 — 7 hours
Started basic firmware.
Tested display output.
Worked on reading rotary encoder.
Had some bugs and fixed logic mistakes.


21 Dec 2025 — 5 hours
Improved firmware flow.
Worked on basic alarm logic.
Did not get everything perfect but learned a lot.
Also started organizing repository files.


22 Dec 2025 — 7 hours
Cleaned up repository structure.
Wrote README and BOM.
Reviewed all files for submission.
Prepared project for Blueprint submission.
